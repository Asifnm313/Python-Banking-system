# BANKING SYSTEM
# Project Overview
This project replicates a simple Banking System in Python, leveraging Object-Oriented Programming (OOP) principles. The system provides basic banking functionalities, including account login, depositing money, withdrawing money, and checking account balance.

# Features
1. Account Login

* Prevents withdrawal of invalid or excessive amounts.
4. Check Balance

* Displays the current balance of the logged-in account.
5. Exit Option

* Users can exit the system gracefully.
# Technologies Used
* Python: Core programming language.
* Jupyter Notebook: For interactive development and testing.
* Object-Oriented Programming (OOP): To structure and organize the program effectively.
